= Spring Boot Guava Cache Sample

This example demonstrates the Guava caching configuration. Spring's caching
abstraction is supported by many caching libraries, including Guava.

Purpose of this example is caching of the Session object previously loaded from
the database. In order to minimize database load application caches Session object
for configured TTL (e.g. 10 seconds) so as soon as TTL will be exceeded Session object
will be removed from the cache by the appropriate Cache Manager, Guava in our case.

You can look at the `/metrics` endpoint to review the cache statistics of Guava
caching provider. It also shows that the number of cached objects is not constant and
objects are evicted from cached actually.
